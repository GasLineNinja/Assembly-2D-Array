# Assembly-2D-Array

# This program will prompt the user for dimensions for a 2D
#	array(matrix). It will dynamically allocte and then read in double-
#	precision numbers until full. The program will then print the 
#	matix to the console as a table. the program will create the 
#	transpose of the matrix and print that to the console as well. 
#	Lastly the user will be asked for a valid row and column 
#	index of the transposed array and a submatrix will be 
#	created excluding the row and column and will be printed
#	to the console.
